<Body> My favourite Movie is Smokey and the bandit<br>
	<img src="download.jpg" alt="Movie Poster">
<p>Summary: Bandit has to go from Texas to Georgia 
 steal 400 cases of beer
on a bet that he couldn't do it in 28 hours or less </p>
My favourite quote: Hey sheriff I can't lie to a good man like you look over your left shoulder where off to New England to get some clam chowder bye bye
